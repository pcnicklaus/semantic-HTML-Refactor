  	<h1 id="pageTwo">Where I'm going...</h1>
  	<p>Is technically anyone's guess! My life path has been a bit circuituos to say the least but isn't that what makes life so fun? I truly believe in having a basic plan and adapting, adjusting or altering it to fit the current reality we all inhabit. That being said, I think gSchool is really going to help me find a really cool company to be a part of or maybe some of us in here will start something even cooler!</p>

  	<h4 id="build">I've always...</h4>
  	<p id="buildP">Felt there's something that I need to do, build or create and I truly believe that doing this cohort and program is going to help me find what it is and provide some of the the wherewithall (love that word) to help me get there!</p>

    <hr>

  	<h4 id="goals">My goals...</h4>
  	<p id="goalsP">Are ever changing but one of the has to be to build something amazingly cool. Again, not exactly sure what that is but I gotta couple ideas that I can't wait to bounce off you, my gSchool homies (and guinea pigs)! Mwah, hah, hah, hah!!! If you couldn't tell, that was a maniacal laugh.</p>

    <hr>

  	<h4 id="lesson">Most importantly...</h4>
  	<p id="lessonP">I've learned that life is a series of crazy events and the best thing I can do in my life and career is be happy, bring joy, cause laughter and surround myself with like minded, very cool people. So I am absolutely ecstatic to meet you and really look forward to the learning with & about you during our time together!</p>

  	<h4>Finally...</h4>
  	<p>These videos all show how i feel about starting my new career in programming.</p>
